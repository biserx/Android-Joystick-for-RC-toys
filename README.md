# Android-Joystick-for-RC-toys
This app simulates RC transmitter (control sticks), for remote controlled models. With other words it's a joystick running on your mobile screen.

It was initially made for RCBoat project (https://github.com/biserx/RCBoat/), but there is enought space to make it more general, and cover some other RC toys or implement other ways of communication alongside wifi communication.

You can finde more info about RCBoat project on my blog: http://biser.xyz/en/rcboat-got-an-upgrade-esp8266/
