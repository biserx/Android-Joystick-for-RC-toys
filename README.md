# Android-Joystick-for-RC-toys

This app simulates RC transmitter (control sticks), for remote controlled models. With other words it's a joystick.
It provides control of two control sticks in two axes. No extra buttons for now.

Source code also provides an example how to esablish a communication with an RC model using UDP protool. 
Example is actually a working prototype joystick for RC Boat.

It is easy to implement any type of communication, and it's also possible to handle more implementation, so you can control more models with one app. 

It was initially made for RCBoat project (https://github.com/biserx/RCBoat/), but there is enought space to make it more general, and cover some other RC toys or implement other ways of communication alongside wifi communication.
